# Meme-Modeler
This study is based off a previous research project titled "The growth, spread, and mutation of internet phenomena: A study of memes". Based on the previous results, the authors classified the memes dataset into four categories: “smoothly decaying” , “spikey decaying”, “leveling off”, and “long-term growth”.

During this project, we will use supervised classification algorithms (such as SVC, KNN) and unsupervised classification algorithms (K-means) to apply on the memes dataset, and then investigate the results to make a deeper understanding about different classification machine learning algorithms.
